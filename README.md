# Project 3: Spots

## Descrition

At first, the project was challenging and a bit confusing. It felt like a big leap for me, and I had to rewatch the tutorial videos multiple times just to understand what I was doing. However, this process helped me improve my problem-solving skills. I also reached out to the tutors for help when I needed it. Honestly, I’m surprised I made it this far. I know I probably made a lot of mistakes, but I did my best to check my work carefully and learn from the experience.
